        <p id="aboutMeContent" class="startText">I graduated from MTSU with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology. I attended Trevecca University for my graduate program, and received a Masters of Arts in counseling. I am a Licensed Professional
          Counselor, licensed by the
          State of Tennessee (TN 2157), with a Mental Health Service Provider designation <span class="moreText">
            <br><br>
            Before I started my private practice, I worked for 13 years doing psychiatric evaluations and psychiatric assessment in Vanderbilt Medical Center's Department of Psychiatry. While there, I trained with Steve Hollon, PhD, an
            internationally
            recognized expert in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
            <br>
            I use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and specialize in working with clients who are experiencing depression, anxiety, grief, relationship issues, trauma, life transition, LGBT+, and those who are in alternative relationships or
            alternative
            lifestyles. I only treat individuals, not couples.<br>
            <br>
            My passions are counseling and pets. My dog, Navi, will be present for your sessions. He is a bit camera- shy, so you may not see him, but you may hear his gentle snoring, or his not-so-gentle "YIP!," as he dreams. Be prepared for me to
            ask
            you about any pets you have.<br>
            <br>
            If you’re struggling right now I really encourage you to reach out. We can do it together. We’ll work together to empower you with the tools you need to challenge what isn’t working, and start building a more satisfying life.<br>
            <br>
            I'm currently accepting new clients. I look forward to meeting you!

      <p>Navi is my 11-12 year old Shih Tzu. He was once used as a breeder dog (stud), but when his owner thought he and his brothers and sisters were getting too old to breed, they were given up to a shelter. A rescue organization found them and took them to various no-kill shelters around town. I met Navi at a local pet store adoption event. He was very shy but very sweet and handsome. He seemed to like me, too, and we've been good friends since then.
  You may not see him (he's a bit camera-shy) but you may catch a glimpse of him or hear him when he snores or calls out "YIP" while dreaming.</p>

      <li class="serviceHeading">Depression and Bipolar Disorders</li>
      <img class="serviceImage" src="images/depression.webp" alt="">
      <p class="serviceDescription">If you need support with low mood or trouble enjoying things, I can help you find your positivity, and start living life to the full. I provide Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for those struggling with depressive disorders. Depression is a common condition that can be triggered by traumatic events, or it may appear for seemingly no reason. It can cause feelings like loneliness, guilt, and worthlessness. Sadly, many people struggle with the condition on their own, for months or even years, before getting professional help.<br><br>If you suspect you may be experiencing depression do get in touch with me or another healthcare professional. Depression can be effectively treated, but only you can take the first step.
      <br><br>I also provide support and counseling for those who have bipolar disorders. Extreme mood swings, very high to very low, may be a bipolar disorder.</p>

      <li class="serviceHeading">Anxiety</li>
      <p class="serviceDescription">I treat anxiety with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Whether you are suffering from a generalized anxiety about nearly everything or anxiety mostly in social situations, we can work together to overcome your fears and anxieties.<br><br>
        I will provide ways for you to understand your anxiety. I help you make sense of these feelings and overcome them so you can move forward feeling comfortable and confident. You will learn proven methods so you can thrive. I can teach you strategies for calming, coping, and relaxing. When thoughts start to spiral out of control, you will understand what is happening and be able to act. You will be running your life, not your anxiety.</p>

      <li class="serviceHeading">LGBTQIA+</li>
      <img class="serviceImage" src="images/lgbtq.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="serviceDescription">Although a person’s sexual or romantic orientation or gender identity may not be a source of distress, people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, asexual, or any other orientation or gender identity may find that the social stigma of living as a minority is a source of stress or anxiety.<br><br>
Whether you are seeking therapy for issues associated with your sexual, romantic, or gender identity or for concerns related to mental health, I have experience and familiarity with the challenges members of the LGBTQIA community often face. If the situation suggests it, I will be happy to provide a letter of recommendation for surgery or to begin hormone treatment. (May require ongoing therapy.) I am experienced and knowledgeable in treating issues that arise in alternative relationships.</p>


      <li class="serviceHeading">Grief, Trauma, Stress, Coping Skills, Self Esteem, and Other Concerns</li>
      <p class="serviceDescription">I also provide therapy for persons dealing with grief, who have experienced trauma in their lives, have issues coping, dealing with low self-esteem or confidence, and other mental health or emotional concerns.<br><br>
        You and I will be a team, working to improve your emotional well-being and functioning. </p>
