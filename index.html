        <p id="aboutMeContent" class="startText">I graduated from MTSU with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology. I attended Trevecca University for my graduate program, and received a Masters of Arts in counseling. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor, licensed by the
          State of Tennessee (TN 2157), with a Mental Health Service Provider designation <span class="moreText">
          <br><br>
          Before I started my private practice, I worked for 13 years doing psychiatric evaluations and psychiatric assessment in Vanderbilt Medical Center's Department of Psychiatry. While there, I trained with Steve Hollon, PhD, an internationally
          recognized expert in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
          <br>
          I use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and specialize in working with clients who are experiencing depression, anxiety, grief, relationship issues, trauma, life transition, LGBT+, and those who are in alternative relationships or alternative
          lifestyles. I only treat individuals, not couples.<br>
          <br>
          My passions are counseling and pets. My dog, Navi, will be present for your sessions. He is a bit camera- shy, so you may not see him, but you may hear his gentle snoring, or his not-so-gentle "YIP!," as he dreams. Be prepared for me to ask
          you about any pets you have.<br>
          <br>
          If you’re struggling right now I really encourage you to reach out. We can do it together. We’ll work together to empower you with the tools you need to challenge what isn’t working, and start building a more satisfying life.<br>
          <br>
          I'm currently accepting new clients. I look forward to meeting you!
